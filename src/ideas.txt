!schedule <station>

!when <color> <station>

!howto <from station> <to station>
    will have to implement pathfinding
    get lists of routes of each color
    create a graph where the edges have a weight of distance and get intersections by finding locations that have multiple colors
        changing lines should also have some factor, otherwise there may be multiple shortest paths where you change colors 
        (silver and orange line have a lot in common for example)

change the output from when to be "for <color> line, the next arrivals are..." by default
or by the train destination with an extra input
